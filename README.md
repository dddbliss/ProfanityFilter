**Note:** Replace ```Sworup Shakya``` ```sworup``` ```http://sworup.com.np``` ```sworup.shakya@gmail.com``` ```Profanity Filter 2``` ```Profanity filter package would help you censor some of the bad words users put in your posts and/or comments.``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
